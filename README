## Academic structurize C src's

### What is it intended for?

-> ___Students who wanna follow along with this repository, who wanna learn C from someone on their path, or my peers who are curious and wanna master C before moving on to other languages.___

### How is it different from other tutorials of C?

-> ___For startes, this is made by myself, which means all codes here are written without/with barely use of AI. Which means other contributers can help solidify my knowledge if they know any good alternative coding styles and habits, that can improve or sometimes fix my code. Hence, why this repository is more-focused on engagement than actual follow up___
